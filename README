The navy is imitating the board game naval battle.

In order to play you will have to open 2 shells.
In the first one you have to launch the binary "./navy ships_positions", and in the second shell "./navy first_player_pid ships_positions". ships_positions being the file containing positions of your ships.

Your file will have 4 lines, they will be formatted the following way : "LENGTH:FIRST_SQUARE:LAST_SQUARE".

LENGTH is the ship's length, you have 4 value : 2, 3, 4 and 5.
FIRST_SQUARE and LAST_SQUARE are respectively the first and last position.

Here are some examples :

2:C1:C2
4:B5:B8
3:D4:F4
5:D7:H7

2:C4:D4
3:H1:H3
4:E6:H6
5:B1:F1

And here is the map so you can visualize :
